In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a full stack 
Node.js Express + Vue.js Authentication example. 

The back-end server uses Node.js Express with jsonwebtoken 
for JWT authentication and Sequelize for interacting with MySQL 
database & Authorization. The front-end will be created with 
Vue and Vuex. Weâ€™ll also use vee-validate to perform Form 
validation and vue-fontawesome for make our UI more comfortable to view.
